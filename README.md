# Betterfy-Music-Player
Music player created using the Spotify Web API and the Web Playback SDK that I am working on in my free time; I plan on connecting it to other music APIs such as Apple Music and SoundCloud. It is using the MERN stack and will use a mLab cloud database to store users listening information.

Run **yarn start:client** to start client or cd into the my-app folder and run **npm start**
Run **yarn start:server** to start server
Run **yarn start:dev** to start both
